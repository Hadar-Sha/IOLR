# Outline
Navigation of Underwater Autonomous Vehicle (AUV)
## Motivation
Challenge: GPS doesn't work underwater

Acoustic sensors are used underwater

The AUV is sent to a mission and needs to dock to charge / transfer data

Our focus: improving AUV localization
## Settings
Acoustic sensors are placed on the seabed and send info
